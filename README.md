Meeting Management & Attendance Tracking System
A smart platform designed for structured meeting workflows, strict conflict prevention, and real-time attendance tracking. This system ensures zero scheduling conflicts and provides full traceability from creation to completion.

🚀 Core Features:

📅 Lifecycle Management: Create → HOD Approval → Scheduled → Completed. Rejected/Cancelled meetings move to a dedicated history.

🚫 Zero Conflicts: Hard blocks on scheduling if a Venue or Attendee is already occupied. Unavailable users are filtered from dropdowns.

⏱ Attendance Tracking: Real-time presence monitoring. Attendance recorded as a percentage of total meeting duration.

📝 Restricted Minutes: Minutes are creator-only and strictly editable only during the live meeting window.

🔁 Follow-Up Workflow: Auto-trigger follow-up meetings upon completion, maintaining context chains with visual markers (F).

🔔 Role-Based UI: HOD notification badges for approvals; distinct card views for scheduled vs. cancelled meetings.
